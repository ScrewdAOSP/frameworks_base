<!-- This is the animation of the Screw'D Logo in statusbar... 
	Use this animation first because changing anything to see how it works-->

<!-- android:duration is how fast in milliseconds each .png will be displayed for -->

    <item android:duration="3000" android:drawable="@drawable/ic_statusbar_screwd1" /> <!-- This is the first .png, the screw with eyes wide open -->
    <item android:duration="200" android:drawable="@drawable/ic_statusbar_screwd2" /> <!-- This is the second .png, the screw with eyes half open -->
    <item android:duration="200" android:drawable="@drawable/ic_statusbar_screwd3" /> <!-- This is the third .png, the screw with eyes closed -->
    <item android:duration="200" android:drawable="@drawable/ic_statusbar_screwd2" />
    <item android:duration="1200" android:drawable="@drawable/ic_statusbar_screwd1" />
	
	<!-- So by calling each .png in that order above, essentially you will get a smooth transition of the screw closing his eyes, then half opening them and to wide open again...
		The value of 2000 should be kept as this ensures how long in between each blink you want. So right now its at 2 seconds. The 100 value will be fast, obviously haven't tested it yet,
		so you may need to speed it up, by lowering the value, or slowing it down, by raising the value. -->
